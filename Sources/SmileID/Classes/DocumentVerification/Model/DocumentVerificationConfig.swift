    ///   - userId: The user ID to associate with the Document Verification. Most often, this will
    ///   correspond to a unique User ID within your system. If not provided, a random user ID will
    ///    be generated.
    ///   - jobId: The job ID to associate with the Document Verification. Most often, this will
    ///   correspond to unique Job ID within your system. If not provided, a random job ID will
    ///   be generated.
    ///   - allowNewEnroll:  Allows a partner to enroll the same user id again
    ///   - documentType: An optional string for the type of document to be captured
    ///   - idAspectRatio: An optional value for the aspect ratio of the document. If no value is,
    ///   supplied, image analysis is done to calculate the documents aspect ratio
    ///   - bypassSelfieCaptureWithFile: If provided, selfie capture will be bypassed using this
    ///   image
    ///   - captureBothSides: Whether to capture both sides of the ID or not. Otherwise, only the
    ///   front side will be captured. If this is true, an option to skip back side will still be
    ///   shown
    ///  - allowAgentMode: Whether to allow Agent Mode or not. If allowed, a switch will be
    ///   displayed allowing toggling between the back camera and front camera. If not allowed, only
    ///   the front camera will be used.
    ///   - allowGalleryUpload: Whether to allow the user to upload images from their gallery or not
    ///   - showInstructions: Whether to deactivate capture screen's instructions for Document
    ///   Verification (NB! If instructions are disabled, gallery upload won't be possible)
    ///   - showAttribution: Whether to show the Smile ID attribution on the Instructions screen
    ///   - skipApiSubmission: Whether to skip api submission to SmileID and return only captured images
    ///   - extraPartnerParams: Custom values specific to partners
    ///   - countryCode: The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country code of the document
