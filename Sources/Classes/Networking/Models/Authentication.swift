/// The Auth Smile request. Auth Smile serves multiple purposes:
/// - It is used to fetch the signature needed for subsequent API requests
/// - It indicates the type of job that will being performed
/// - It is used to fetch consent information for the partner
///
///  - Parameters:
///    - jobType: The type of job that will be performed
///    - enrollment: Whether or not this is an enrollment job
///    - country: The country code of the country where the job is being performed. This value is
///       required in order to get back consent information for the partner
///    - idType: The type of ID that will be used for the job. This value is required in order to
///      get back consent information for the partner
///    - updateEnrolledImage: Whether or not the enrolled image should be updated with image
///      submitted for this job
///    - jobId: The job ID to associate with the job. Most often, this will correspond to a unique
///      Job ID within your own system. If not provided, a random job ID will be generated
///    - userId: The user ID to associate with the job. Most often, this will correspond to a unique
///      User ID within your own system. If not provided, a random user ID will be generated
///    - signature: Whether or not to fetch the signature for the job
///    - production: Whether or not to use the production environment
///    - partnerId: The partner ID
///    - authToken: The auth token from smile_config.json
